# DiceGame

Main File: Pig.Java

This application is a recreation of the dice game known as "Pig," which has existed since the 1940s. In this game, 2 players take turns rolling dice, rolling as many times as they want within their turn, to reach a maximum score of 100. However, rolling a 1 resets your points earned that turn, while rolling snake eyes resets your total points.
